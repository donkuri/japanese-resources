## Learning guides

This section is dedicated to Japanese learning guides. Start here unless you know what you're doing.

## Hiragana & Katakana

Hiragana and katakana (commonly called *kana* together) form two basic alphabets used in Japanese. You may or may not want to learn how to write them, but at the very least you will need to be able to recognize and read them.

- Memorizing the kana

## Kanji

If you intend to do isolated kanji study, you can use the following resources. **It is strongly suggested to skip straight to vocabulary** and to come back here if really needed, except for the miscellaneous part which can be used rightaway.

- Mnemonics
  - [RRTK450](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ) - A shortened "recognition" version of [RTK](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921). **Disclaimer: The stories were taken from a website and some of there are pretty offensive.**

  - [Kanji Schizo](https://github.com/kaanium/new-kanji-finder) - This Python script lets you find new kanji in `.epub` or subtitle files.

## Vocabulary

Vocabulary refers to words, not kanji directly. Words are usually made up of kanji and one shouldn't confuse the two. As it is recommended to do a mining deck after learning basic vocabulary, there's only a single recommended resource.

- **[Kaishi 1.5k](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/)** - The recommended beginner vocabulary Anki deck. Latest release found [here](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases) and [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551).
